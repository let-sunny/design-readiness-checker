# Roundtrip protocol reference (extracted from the skill)

This document holds **override matrices, annotation enum tables, write-policy tiers, pre-flight probe branches, and the bundled-helper catalogue** so `canicode-roundtrip/SKILL.md` can stay protocol-focused. The canonical source lives in the repo: edit here or the skill — keep them aligned when changing behaviour.

#### Instance-child property overridability (Plugin API)

Most production nodes sit under `INSTANCE` subtrees. `canicode` flags these via `question.isInstanceChild` and, when resolvable, surfaces the definition node id as `question.sourceChildId` plus extra metadata on `question.instanceContext`. You do not need to parse node ids.

Matrix below is confirmed by Experiment 08 ([#290](https://github.com/let-sunny/canicode/issues/290)) probes on shallow + deep instance-child FRAMEs in the Simple Design System fixture. `✅` = raw-value write accepted, `❌` = throws *"cannot be overridden in an instance"*, `⚠️` = no error but value silently unchanged (must detect with before/after compare).

**Per-file caveat:** Cells reflect what Experiment 08 observed on that fixture — another file or component can still land on silent-ignore (`⚠️`) or scene annotation (ADR-012 default) for a property marked `✅` here. Treat the matrix as empirical guidance, not a guarantee for every design.

| Property | Raw-value write on instance child | Variable binding | Notes |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------------|-------|
| `node.name` | ✅ | — | Prefer scene node first. |
| `annotations` | ✅ | — | Good fallback when another property cannot be set. |
| `itemSpacing`, `paddingTop/Right/Bottom/Left` | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `primaryAxisAlignItems`, `counterAxisAlignItems`, `layoutAlign` | ✅ | — | |
| `cornerRadius`, `opacity` | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `fills`, `strokes` (raw color) | ✅ | ✅ via `setBoundVariableForPaint(paint, "color", v)` | |
| `layoutSizingHorizontal` / `layoutSizingVertical` | ✅ | — | |
| `layoutMode` | ⚠️ on some nodes | — | Some instance children silently ignore the write (no throw, no change). |
| **`minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight`** | ❌ on many nodes | **✅** | **Variable binding bypasses the override restriction** — prefer binding when the answer names a token. Raw values route to the definition node after confirmation. |
| `fontSize`, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`, `paragraphSpacing` (TEXT) | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `characters` (TEXT) | ✅ | ✅ STRING variable | |

#### Annotation `properties` matrix

Experiment 09 ([#290 follow-up](https://github.com/let-sunny/canicode/issues/290)) re-measured the full 33-value enum on a scene FRAME (`3077:9894`) and scene TEXT (`3077:9963`) in the Simple Design System fixture. The key finding: **the gate is node-type, not scene-vs-instance**. FRAMEs reject `fills`/`cornerRadius`/`opacity`/`maxWidth`/`effects` regardless of context. Instance children additionally lose `minWidth`/`minHeight`/`alignItems` on FRAMEs — these are instance-override restrictions layered on top.

Each row below covers the full 33-value enum (`width`, `height`, `maxWidth`, `minWidth`, `maxHeight`, `minHeight`, `fills`, `strokes`, `effects`, `strokeWeight`, `cornerRadius`, `textStyleId`, `textAlignHorizontal`, `fontFamily`, `fontStyle`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`, `itemSpacing`, `padding`, `layoutMode`, `alignItems`, `opacity`, `mainComponent`, plus 8 grid props `gridRowGap`/`gridColumnGap`/`gridRowCount`/`gridColumnCount`/`gridRowAnchorIndex`/`gridColumnAnchorIndex`/`gridRowSpan`/`gridColumnSpan`):

| Node type | Accepted (scene) | Additionally rejected on instance child | Rejected in all contexts |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| FRAME | `width`, `height`, `minWidth`, `minHeight`, `itemSpacing`, `padding`, `layoutMode`, `alignItems` | `minWidth`, `minHeight`, `alignItems` | `maxWidth`, `maxHeight`, `fills`, `strokes`, `effects`, `strokeWeight`, `cornerRadius`, `opacity`, `mainComponent`, all 8 text props, all 8 grid props |
| TEXT | `width`, `height`, `fills`, `textStyleId`, `fontFamily`, `fontStyle`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight` | not re-measured — Experiment 08 only probed `strokes`/`opacity`/`cornerRadius`/`effects`/`layoutMode`/`itemSpacing`/`padding` on instance-child TEXT, and all were rejected there too | `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight`, `strokes`, `effects`, `strokeWeight`, `cornerRadius`, `opacity`, `textAlignHorizontal`, `letterSpacing`, `itemSpacing`, `padding`, `layoutMode`, `alignItems`, `mainComponent`, all 8 grid props |

`upsertCanicodeAnnotation` wraps the write in `try/catch`: if `properties` fails node-type validation it retries without them, so the markdown body always survives. You can pass `properties` speculatively.

> **Note:** This policy has shipped per ADR-012 (resolves [#295](https://github.com/let-sunny/canicode/issues/295)): **scene write by default; definition write is opt-in** behind `allowDefinitionWrite`. The bundled helper and the prose below match — reading one without the other is safe.

**Write policy (ordered tiers):**

The helper walks the tiers in order; variable binding is an alternative writeFn shape available at tiers 1 and 2 that bypasses the instance-child override gate (Experiment 08) — it is *not* a separate ordering position between the tiers.

1. **Scene (instance) node** — `await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(question.nodeId)` and apply the write inside `try/catch`. If the answer names a design-system token (`{ variable: "name" }`), the helper calls `setBoundVariable` / `setBoundVariableForPaint` first and that binding bypasses the override gate — otherwise it performs a raw-value write. Success → done (local change only). Mark result with ✅.
2. **Definition (source) node — opt-in only** — Runs only when the orchestrator passes `allowDefinitionWrite: true` on the helper context (after a batch-level confirmation naming the source component AND the propagation set). When the flag is off (the ADR-012 default), a recognized instance-override failure (override-error or silent-ignore) short-circuits here and routes directly to tier 3 — the definition node is never touched. When the flag is on, the helper loads `question.sourceChildId` (or walks `getMainComponentAsync()` if needed) and writes using the same bind-if-token-else-raw shape as tier 1; changes propagate to **every non-overridden instance** in the file (Experiment 10). Mark result with 🌐.
3. **Annotation fallback — default path** — Under the ADR-012 default this is where override-errors and silent-ignores land: the helper annotates the **scene** node with markdown that states whether the failure was a silent-ignore (write ran but value unchanged) or an override-error (Figma rejected the instance write), explains why the source component was not modified by default, and warns that `allowDefinitionWrite: true` propagates to every inheriting instance — not a neutral retry (#443). When `allowDefinitionWrite` is on, this tier also catches any definition-tier throw (e.g. Experiment 10 external-library read-only case, `mainComponent.remote === true` / *"Cannot write to internal and read-only node"*, and the `mainComponent === null` branch where `getMainComponentAsync()` resolves with no definition to name — see Experiment 11 / ADR-011). Either way, mark result with 📝.

**Confirmation is a batch-level concern — and only needed when opting in.** A `use_figma` call runs one JavaScript batch and cannot pause mid-batch for user input. Under the ADR-012 default (`allowDefinitionWrite: false`), no propagation happens, so no confirmation is required — override-errors annotate and move on. The orchestrator sets `allowDefinitionWrite: true` only after enumerating the likely propagation set to the user up-front and collecting **one confirmation for the whole batch** that names the source component(s) and the affected instance set. When describing impact, note that the write reaches every **non-overridden** instance — any instance with a local override for the same property keeps its override. The helper below never prompts — it assumes that if the flag is on, confirmation already happened.

**Threshold heuristic — when to surface the picker (#428).** The `allowDefinitionWrite` opt-in flow is over-engineered for tiny surveys. Use `survey.suggestedDefaultApply` (a boolean computed server-side by `generateGotchaSurvey`) to gate the picker:

- **`survey.suggestedDefaultApply === false`** (fewer than 3 instance-child questions in the survey) — skip the picker entirely and call the helpers with the default `allowDefinitionWrite: false`. Every override-error routes to a scene annotation per ADR-012. Do not ask the user about propagation.
- **`survey.suggestedDefaultApply === true`** (3 or more instance-child questions) — surface the pre-flight probe and picker as usual. The threshold is `propagationCandidates >= 3` where `propagationCandidates = questions.filter(q => q.isInstanceChild).length`.

The skill may still override this hint — for example, when `probeDefinitionWritability` returns `allUnwritable === true`, drop to annotate-only regardless of `suggestedDefaultApply`.

**Pre-flight writability probe (#357).** Before showing the user the Definition write picker, call `CanICodeRoundtrip.probeDefinitionWritability(questions)` inside a small `use_figma` batch. The probe loads every distinct `sourceChildId` once and classifies it as writable or unwritable using the same detection as the runtime fallback (Experiment 10 `remote === true` and Experiment 11 unresolved-`null`). The result decides which version of the picker to show:

```javascript
// Inside a use_figma batch:
const probe = await CanICodeRoundtrip.probeDefinitionWritability(questions);
return { events: [], probe };
```

Branches on `probe`:

- **`allUnwritable === true`** — every candidate source is in an external library (or unresolved). Opting in is structurally a no-op; every write would throw "Cannot write to internal and read-only node" and fall through to scene annotation anyway. Show the user a single-option picker:

  ```
  Definition write policy

  This file's source components live in an external library and are
  read-only from here ({unwritableSourceNames.join(", ")}). Tier 2
  propagation cannot fire — every "opt-in" write would fall through
  to a scene annotation regardless.

  ❯ 1. Annotate only (only viable option for this file)
    2. Cancel — duplicate the library locally first to enable propagation
  ```

  Skip the opt-in branch entirely and call the helpers with the default `allowDefinitionWrite: false`.

- **`partiallyUnwritable === true`** — some sources are local, some remote. Surface the split:

  ```
  Definition write policy

  {unwritableCount} of {totalCount} source components are remote
  (read-only) and will fall through to annotation; the remaining
  {totalCount - unwritableCount} are local and will propagate.
  Remote sources: {unwritableSourceNames.join(", ")}.

  Continue with allowDefinitionWrite: true?
  ```

  When confirmed, propagate to the local sources and let the helper's runtime fallback annotate the remote ones — the existing Experiment-10 retry path absorbs them without aborting the batch.

- **`allUnwritable === false && partiallyUnwritable === false`** (the all-local / no-candidates case) — show the existing batch-level picker prose. No probe-driven adjustment needed.

The probe is read-only and idempotent; running it before the picker adds one round-trip but saves the user a confusing "I opted in, why did I get annotations?" moment that #342 surfaced live on Simple Design System (Community).

**Shared helpers (bundled)** — the deterministic helpers live in TypeScript at `src/core/roundtrip/*.ts` and are bundled to a single IIFE shipped next to this skill as `helpers.js`. `use_figma` only accepts a self-contained JS string, so the source of truth is TypeScript (with vitest coverage) and the bundle is the delivery artifact.

**TypeScript for editors (#473)** — `canicode-roundtrip-helpers.d.ts` ships beside the bundles (same paths as `helpers.js` after `canicode init`). It is for IDE autocomplete only; Figma ignores it. Optional `/// <reference path="…/canicode-roundtrip-helpers.d.ts" />` in a local scratch `.ts` file when authoring batch bodies.

**Cached delivery (#424, ADR-020)** — the helpers IIFE is currently ~31KB. Prepending it on every `use_figma` batch crowds the ~50KB soft code-string budget and multiplies when the roundtrip splits across batches. Two sibling artifacts are emitted next to `helpers.js` to solve this:

- **Install batch** — prepend `helpers-installer.js`. It registers `CanICodeRoundtrip` for the current batch (so the install batch can do real work) AND writes the helpers source onto `figma.root` via `setSharedPluginData`. Cache shape: namespace `"canicode"`, keys `"helpersSrc"` (verbatim helpers IIFE source — the same UTF-8 as `helpers.js`, not double-encoded JSON) and `"helpersVersion"` (canicode version baked in at build time). The **installer file** embeds that source once as a normal JavaScript string literal (the build uses `JSON.stringify` only to escape quotes/newlines for safe pasting into `use_figma`). The namespace + keys are centralised in `src/core/roundtrip/shared-plugin-data.ts`.
- **Subsequent batches** — prepend `helpers-bootstrap.js`. It reads the two keys, compares the cached version against the constant baked into the bootstrap at build time, and `eval`s the cached source to re-register `globalThis.CanICodeRoundtrip`. Only a few hundred bytes, so every batch after the first pays a fractional fraction of the old cost.
- **Version-mismatch / cache-missing fallback** — on a cache miss or a canicode-version mismatch, the bootstrap sets `globalThis.__canicodeBootstrapResult = { canicodeBootstrapResult: "cache-missing" | "version-mismatch", expected, actual }` and throws a `ReferenceError` prefixed `canicode-bootstrap:` so the batch self-reports. The orchestrator re-prepends `helpers-installer.js` on the next batch and retries.
- **Persistence trade-off** — `figma.root.setSharedPluginData` persists across sessions, so cached helpers live with the file forever unless overwritten by a newer install or deleted manually. The cost is one ~31KB string in file metadata (invisible to designers); the alternative is re-pasting ~31KB on every batch of every roundtrip. Documented in ADR-020 as an explicit trade.
- **File-edit permission** — `setSharedPluginData` requires the same file-edit permission already required by any roundtrip apply step, so this path adds no new permission surface.

The existing single-artifact usage (prepend `helpers.js` on every batch) stays supported as a conservative fallback for hosts that strip shared plugin data or for smoke-debugging sessions.

**Usage in a roundtrip session (preferred cached path):**

1. Read `helpers-installer.js` from the same directory as this skill — `.claude/skills/canicode-roundtrip/helpers-installer.js` (Claude Code / default `canicode init`) or `.cursor/skills/canicode-roundtrip/helpers-installer.js` (Cursor with `canicode init --cursor-skills`). Prepend its contents verbatim at the top of the first `use_figma` batch body (smoke check + install).
2. Read `helpers-bootstrap.js` from the same directory once. Prepend its contents verbatim at the top of every subsequent `use_figma` batch body — it restores the global `CanICodeRoundtrip` from cache.
3. On a `canicode-bootstrap:` ReferenceError (or `__canicodeBootstrapResult.canicodeBootstrapResult !== undefined`), re-prepend `helpers-installer.js` on the next batch.

**Usage (conservative single-artifact fallback):** prepend `helpers.js` on every batch — same directory as this skill, registers the global `CanICodeRoundtrip` directly.

See the "Mandatory preflight" block at the start of Step 4 in [`.claude/skills/canicode-roundtrip/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/let-sunny/canicode/blob/main/.claude/skills/canicode-roundtrip/SKILL.md#step-4-apply-gotcha-answers-to-figma-design) for the agent-facing checklist.

3. Reference exposed globals as `CanICodeRoundtrip.*`:
   - `stripAnnotations(annotations)` — normalizes the D1 label/labelMarkdown mutex on readback.
   - `ensureCanicodeCategories()` — returns `{ gotcha, flag, fallback }` category id map (D4); idempotent, safe to call at the top of every batch. May also include `legacyAutoFix` when the file already carries the pre-#355 `canicode:auto-fix` category from earlier roundtrips — read-only on the canicode side, used only by Step 5 cleanup to sweep old annotations.
   - `upsertCanicodeAnnotation(node, { ruleId, markdown, categoryId, properties })` — idempotent annotation upsert. Handles D1 mutex, D2 in-place replace by ruleId prefix, and the D3 `properties` node-type retry.
   - `applyWithInstanceFallback(question, writeFn, { categories, allowDefinitionWrite, telemetry, roundtripIntent? })` — three-tier write policy with silent-ignore detection. `allowDefinitionWrite` defaults to `false` per ADR-012 — override-errors and silent-ignores annotate the scene naming the source component instead of writing the definition. Set `true` only after a batch-level confirmation. `telemetry` is an optional `(event, props) => void` callback fired when a definition write is skipped (wiring point for future Node-side opt-in usage data). The `writeFn` may return `false` to signal "write accepted but value unchanged" so the helper can route to the next tier. **Annotation category (#444):** `upsertCanicodeAnnotation` uses `categoryId: canicode:fallback` only on the true ADR-012 path (source definition exists, `allowDefinitionWrite: false`, annotate instead of propagating). If the helper annotates because there is no definition, a definition write failed, or a non-override error — use **`canicode:gotcha`** when `roundtripIntent` is passed (survey answer captured), else **`canicode:flag`**. Avoid labeling those cases `fallback` when nothing was fallen back from.
   - `applyPropertyMod(question, answerValue, { categories, allowDefinitionWrite, telemetry })` — Strategy A entry point. Branches on `targetProperty` (single vs array) and answer shape (scalar, per-property object, `{ variable: "name" }` binding). Uses `setBoundVariableForPaint` for `fills` / `strokes` and `setBoundVariable` for scalar fields. Passes the full context through to `applyWithInstanceFallback`.
   - `resolveVariableByName(name)` — local-variable exact-name lookup; returns `null` for remote library variables not imported into this file.
   - `probeDefinitionWritability(questions)` — async pre-flight (#357). Returns `{ totalCount, unwritableCount, unwritableSourceNames, allUnwritable, partiallyUnwritable }`. Use BEFORE the Definition write picker so the picker can drop the opt-in branch when every candidate is in an external library / unresolved (saves the user a wasted "I opted in, why did I get annotations?" decision). Read-only probe, dedupes by `sourceChildId`.
   - `extractAcknowledgmentsFromNode(node, canicodeCategoryIds?)` — synchronous pure helper (#371). Reads one node's annotations and returns `{ nodeId, ruleId }[]` for entries gated by canicode `categoryId` plus a recognisable `— *<ruleId>*` footer (or legacy `**[canicode] <ruleId>**` prefix). When `canicodeCategoryIds` is omitted, footer-text matching alone is sufficient (test mode).
   - `readCanicodeAcknowledgments(rootNodeId, categories?)` — async tree walker (#371). Loads `rootNodeId` via `figma.getNodeByIdAsync`, recurses through `children`, and accumulates one acknowledgment per recognised entry. Used at the top of Step 5a to harvest the side channel that lets the analysis pipeline distinguish "still broken" from "the designer has a plan" — pass the result straight to `analyze({ acknowledgments })`. Errors on individual nodes are swallowed so locked / external nodes don't abort the sweep.
   - `computeRoundtripTally({ stepFourReport, reanalyzeResponse })` — pure helper (#383). Takes the structured Step 4 outcome counts (`{ resolved, annotated, definitionWritten, skipped }`) plus a narrowed re-analyze view (`{ issueCount, acknowledgedCount }`) and returns `{ X, Y, Z, W, N, V, V_ack, V_open }`. Replaces the LLM-side emoji-bullet re-counting in Step 5 — render the returned object directly into the wrap-up templates. Throws when `acknowledgedCount > issueCount` (impossible state).
   - `applyAutoFix(issue, { categories, allowDefinitionWrite?, telemetry? })` — Strategy D entry point (#386). Branches on `targetProperty === "name" && suggestedName` once: renames the node via `applyWithInstanceFallback` (so naming auto-fixes share the same tier-1/2/3 policy as Strategy A) or writes a `categories.flag` annotation carrying `issue.message` and `issue.annotationProperties`. Returns one `AutoFixOutcome` (`{ outcome, nodeId, nodeName, ruleId, label }`) where `outcome` is `🔧` / `🌐` / `📝` so Step 4 can bump the structured `stepFourReport` counters without parsing prose. Replaces the inline JS the SKILL used to carry (per ADR-016).
   - `applyAutoFixes(issues, { categories, allowDefinitionWrite?, telemetry? })` — loop wrapper (#386). Filters `issues` to `applyStrategy === "auto-fix"` (skipped entries surface as `⏭️` outcomes for symmetry) and applies each one in sequence. Returns the full `AutoFixOutcome[]`.
   - `removeCanicodeAnnotations(annotations, categories)` — pure filter. Returns `annotations` with every canicode-authored entry removed (gates on `categories.gotcha` / `flag` / `fallback` / `legacyAutoFix` plus the legacy `**[canicode]` body prefix). Use after `stripAnnotations` in the Step 5 cleanup loop — replaces the inline filter predicate the SKILL used to carry. `isCanicodeAnnotation(annotation, categories)` is the single-entry version, exported for callers that need the predicate alone.

Keep each `writeFn` small so a throw does not abort unrelated writes. Experiment 08 findings informed every branch in the bundled helpers, and the batch-level confirmation contract still applies *when opting in*: if the orchestrator passes `allowDefinitionWrite: true`, it must have already collected one confirmation covering every potential definition write in the batch. Under the default, no confirmation is needed — the helper annotates the scene instead of propagating.

Wrap every property write in `CanICodeRoundtrip.applyWithInstanceFallback(question, async (target) => { ... }, { categories })` so failed or silently-ignored instance overrides route to the scene annotation (or, when the user has opted in, to the definition tier) instead of silently aborting the batch.

## Appendix — Step 3 grouped survey (`groupedQuestions`)

#### Step 3a: Why the response carries a pre-grouped+batched view

The naive "one-question-at-a-time" loop produces two well-known UX failures on real designs:

- **Repeated Instance note (#370)** — when 10 consecutive questions share the same `instanceContext.sourceComponentId`, the standard "_Instance note: …source component **X**…_" paragraph prints 10 times. After the first occurrence it adds zero new information and consumes ~2 screens of vertical space.
- **Repeated identical answer (#369)** — when 7 consecutive questions all carry the same `ruleId` (e.g. `missing-size-constraint`) and the user's reasonable answer would be the same for all of them (e.g. `min-width: 320px, max-width: 1200px`), the user types the same thing 7 times in a row.

`gotcha-survey` already ships the resolution on its `groupedQuestions` field. Sort key (`(sourceComponentId ?? "_no-source", ruleId, nodeName)`), source-component grouping, and both batchable-rule whitelists all live in `core/gotcha/group-and-batch-questions.ts` with vitest coverage:

- **`BATCHABLE_RULE_IDS`** (`safe` batch mode — one uniform answer by definition): `missing-size-constraint`, `irregular-spacing`, `no-auto-layout`, `fixed-size-in-auto-layout`.
- **`OPT_IN_BATCHABLE_RULE_IDS`** (`opt-in` batch mode — shared answer offered as a default with per-node override via `split`): `missing-prototype` (#426).

Each batch carries a pre-computed `batchMode: "safe" | "opt-in" | "none"` so the prompt template branches without re-deriving the whitelist in prose. Per ADR-016, do **not** re-implement the sort, partition, or whitelists in prose — iterate over `groupedQuestions.groups[].batches[]` directly.

#### Step 3b: Prompt each group, then each batch within it

For each `group` in `response.groupedQuestions.groups`:

- **`group.instanceContext === null`** — this is the trailing group of non-instance questions. Skip the header and prompt each batch directly.
- **`group.instanceContext !== null`** — emit the Instance note **once** as a group header (#370):

  ```
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  The next {sum of batch.questions.length} questions all target instance children of source component **{instanceContext.sourceComponentName ?? instanceContext.sourceComponentId ?? "unknown"}** (definition node `{instanceContext.sourceNodeId}`). Layout and size fixes may need to apply on the source and propagate to all instances — you will be asked to confirm before any definition-level write.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  ```

For each `batch` inside the group:

- **`batch.questions.length === 1`** — render the standard single-question block for `batch.questions[0]`:

  ```
  **[{severity}] {ruleId}** — node: {nodeName}

  {question}

  > Hint: {hint}
  > Example: {example}
  ```

  **If `question.replicas` is present (#356 dedup)**, prepend one note above the standard block:

  ```
  _Replicas: This question represents **{replicas} instances** of the same source-component child sharing the same rule. Your single answer will be applied to all of them in Step 4 (one annotation/write per instance scene)._
  ```

- **`batch.batchMode === "safe"` && `batch.questions.length >= 2`** (#369) — every member's answer is uniformly applicable (rule in `BATCHABLE_RULE_IDS`). Render one batch prompt covering all members. Use `batch.totalScenes` (already summed across each member's `replicas`) for the Figma-scene fan-out hint:

  ```
  **[{severity}] {batch.ruleId}** — {batch.questions.length} instances:
    - {nodeName₁}{ruleSpecificContext₁}
    - {nodeName₂}{ruleSpecificContext₂}
    - …

  {sharedQuestionPrompt}

  Reply with one answer to apply to all {batch.questions.length}, or **split** to answer each individually.

  > Hint: {hint}
  > Example: {example}
  ```

  Where:
  - `sharedQuestionPrompt` is the rule's `question` text with the per-node noun replaced by the rule's plural noun (e.g. "These layers all use FILL sizing without min/max constraints. What size boundaries should they share?" instead of repeating "What size boundaries should this layer have?" N times).
  - `ruleSpecificContext` is short and rule-specific: e.g. for `missing-size-constraint` show the current `width`/`height` if the question has them; for `irregular-spacing` show the current `itemSpacing`; otherwise omit.
  - On `split`, fall back to the per-question loop for that batch only — keep the rest of the group's batches as-is.

  When `batch.totalScenes > batch.questions.length` (at least one member carries replicas), append one note so the user knows their single answer fans out further than the listed nodes:

  ```
  _Replicas: your one answer will land on **{batch.totalScenes}** Figma scenes total in Step 4 (some of these {batch.questions.length} questions already represent multiple instances of the same source-component child)._
  ```

- **`batch.batchMode === "opt-in"` && `batch.questions.length >= 2`** (#426) — rule in `OPT_IN_BATCHABLE_RULE_IDS` (currently `missing-prototype`). The shared answer is offered as a suggested default rather than a uniform truth, because the per-node specifics (target routes, modals vs pages, etc.) may legitimately diverge. Render a variant header that calls out the opt-in framing explicitly:

  ```
  **[{severity}] {batch.ruleId}** — {batch.questions.length} instances of the same rule:
    - {nodeName₁}{ruleSpecificContext₁}
    - {nodeName₂}{ruleSpecificContext₂}
    - …

  {sharedQuestionPrompt}

  Apply this answer to all {batch.questions.length} occurrences of `{batch.ruleId}`, or reply **split** to answer each individually.

  > Hint: {hint}
  > Example: {example}
  ```

  Reuse the rule's existing `example` (e.g. for `missing-prototype`, "navigates to `/product/{id}` detail page") so the user knows the shared answer can be a **pattern** that templates per-node specifics in Step 4 — not a literal string copied character-for-character to every node. The same `split` / `skip` / `n/a` verbs apply; no new vocabulary.

  When `batch.totalScenes > batch.questions.length`, append the same `_Replicas:_` note as the `safe` branch so the user knows the fan-out count.

- **`batch.batchMode === "none"`** is always rendered as a single-question prompt — the helper guarantees `questions.length === 1` for those (identity-typed answers like `non-semantic-name`, structural-mod rules, and anything not in either whitelist).

**Before presenting the first batch**, display this shortcut notice once so the user knows they can exit early:

```
Survey: {totalBatchCount} question(s) to answer.
Tip: reply `skip remaining` at any point to bypass the rest with a default no-op annotation and finish immediately.
```

Where `totalBatchCount` is `groupedQuestions.groups.flatMap((g) => g.batches).length`.

**After every 3rd batch** (i.e. after batches 3, 6, 9, …), re-surface the shortcut as a brief reminder before presenting the next batch:

```
(You can still reply `skip remaining` to bypass the remaining questions.)
```

When the user replies `skip remaining` at any point during Step 3, immediately treat all unanswered batches as skipped (`{ "skipped": true }` for each unanswered `nodeId`) and proceed directly to Step 4 without asking further questions.

Wait for the user's answer before moving to the next batch. For each batch, the user may:
- Answer the question directly (single value covers all batch members)
- Say **split** (batch only) to fall back to per-question prompting for that batch
- Say **skip** to skip the question / the entire batch
- Say **n/a** if the question / the entire batch is not applicable
- Say **skip remaining** to immediately skip all remaining unanswered batches and proceed to Step 4

When applying the batched answer, expand back to per-question records before storing — the gotcha section format and Step 4 apply loop both expect one record per `nodeId`.

After all questions are answered, upsert via the same **`npx canicode upsert-gotcha-section`** JSON path as `/canicode-gotchas` Step 4b: pass `{ survey: { designKey, designGrade, questions }, answers, designName, figmaUrl, analyzedAt, today }` on stdin with `--input=-` — the CLI renders the section from survey JSON (#439); do not author `## #NNN` markdown in prose. `--file .claude/skills/canicode-gotchas/SKILL.md` and `--design-key` must match `survey.designKey`. Never modify anything above `# Collected Gotchas`.

Then proceed to **Step 4** to apply answers to the Figma design.

## Appendix — Strategy B structural modification

#### Strategy B: Structural Modification — confirm with user first

Rules with `applyStrategy === "structural-mod"`. Show the proposed change and **ask for user confirmation** before applying.

> **Instance-child guard (#368).** Strategy B mutations restructure the layer tree — `createComponentFromNode`, `flatten`, wrapper removal, instance-link reconnection. None of these compose safely with the Plugin API's instance-override rules: on a node where `question.isInstanceChild === true`, calling `createComponentFromNode` either throws *"Cannot create a component from a node inside an instance"* or detaches the parent instance entirely (the picked instance is replaced by a one-off frame, severing every existing override and propagation link). Restructuring deep-nested wrappers inside an instance child has the same risk surface — even when the call doesn't throw, the resulting structure cannot ride the source-component's propagation in future updates.

> Before showing the per-rule prompt below, check `question.isInstanceChild`. If it is true, **do not run the destructive call**. Surface this a/b prompt instead and default to **(a)**:

> **{ruleId}** would normally restructure **{nodeName}** here, but this node lives inside instance **{instanceContext.parentInstanceNodeId}** of source component **{instanceContext.sourceComponentName or sourceComponentId or "unknown"}** (definition node `{instanceContext.sourceNodeId}`). On instance children Plugin API restructuring either fails outright or detaches the parent instance.
>
> ❯ a) Annotate the scene with a recommendation to apply the change on the source definition (safe — picks up via canicode-gotchas in code-gen, source designer can act on it later)
>   b) Detach the parent instance and attempt the restructuring on the resulting one-off frame (destructive — every existing instance override is lost and the node no longer rides the source component's propagation)
> ```
>
> On **(a)**, route to Strategy C — call `upsertCanicodeAnnotation(scene, { ruleId: question.ruleId, markdown: "**Q:** … **A:** Apply on source definition `${instanceContext.sourceNodeId}` (`${instanceContext.sourceComponentName ?? "unknown"}`) — instance-child restructuring would detach the parent instance.", categoryId: categories.gotcha })`. Reference `instanceContext.sourceComponentName` and `instanceContext.sourceNodeId` in the body so the source designer can locate the target.
>
> On **(b)**, gate behind a second confirmation that explicitly names the side effects ("This will detach instance **{parentInstanceNodeId}** — all overrides on it will be lost and it will stop receiving updates from **{sourceComponentName}**. Type the parent instance name to confirm."). Only then execute the per-rule destructive call below.
>
> The same posture as ADR-012's `allowDefinitionWrite: false` default: instance-child structural mutations are off-by-default and require explicit user opt-in *per node*, not per batch — the destructive call here doesn't have a quiet fallback the way Strategy A's `applyWithInstanceFallback` does.

**`non-layout-container`** — Convert Group/Section to Auto Layout frame:
- Prompt: "I'll convert **{nodeName}** to an Auto Layout frame with {direction} layout and {spacing}px gap. Proceed?"
- If confirmed: `applyPropertyMod(question, { layoutMode: "VERTICAL", itemSpacing: 12 })`.

**`deep-nesting`** — Flatten intermediate wrappers or extract sub-component:
- Prompt: "I'll flatten **{nodeName}** by {description from answer}. This changes the layer hierarchy. Proceed?"
- Apply based on the specific answer (remove wrappers, convert padding, etc.).

**`missing-component`** — Convert frame to reusable component:
- Prompt: "I'll convert **{nodeName}** to a reusable component. Proceed?"
- If confirmed:
```javascript
const scene = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(question.nodeId);
if (scene && scene.type === "FRAME") {
  figma.createComponentFromNode(scene);
}
```

**`detached-instance`** — Reconnect to original component:
- Prompt: "I'll reconnect **{nodeName}** to its original component. Any overrides will be preserved. Proceed?"
- Requires finding the original component — if not identifiable, fall back to annotation.

If the user **declines** any structural modification (or the instance-child guard above routes to **(a)**), add an annotation instead (same as Strategy C).

## Appendix — Edge Cases (full list)

## Edge Cases

- **No canicode MCP server**: Fall back to `npx canicode analyze --json` and `npx canicode gotcha-survey --json` — both CLI commands return the same shape as the MCP tools. The Figma MCP is still required for `use_figma` in Step 4; there is no CLI fallback for Figma design edits.
- **No Figma MCP server**: If `get_design_context` or `use_figma` is not found, tell the user to set up the Figma MCP server. Without it, the apply and code generation phases cannot proceed.
- **No edit permission**: If `use_figma` fails with a permission error, tell the user they need Full seat + file edit permission. Fall back to the one-way flow: skip Steps 4-5 and proceed directly to Step 6 with gotcha answers as code generation context.
- **User wants analysis only**: Suggest using `/canicode` instead — it runs analysis without the code generation phase.
- **User wants gotcha survey only**: Suggest using `/canicode-gotchas` instead — it runs the survey and saves answers as a persistent skill file.
- **Partial gotcha answers**: Apply only the answered questions. Skipped/n/a questions are neither applied nor annotated.
- **use_figma call fails for a node**: Report the error for that specific node, continue with other nodes. Failed property modifications become annotations so the context is not lost.
- **Re-analyze shows new issues**: Only address issues from the original gotcha survey. New issues may appear due to structural changes — report them but do not re-enter the gotcha loop.
- **Very large design (many gotchas)**: The gotcha survey already deduplicates sibling nodes and filters to blocking/risk plus `missing-info` from info-collection rules (#406). If there are still many questions, ask the user if they want to focus on blocking issues only.
- **External library components**: Applies only when the orchestrator has set `allowDefinitionWrite: true`. Experiment 10's observed case is `getMainComponentAsync()` resolving with `mainComponent.remote === true` — writes then throw *"Cannot write to internal and read-only node"*. The `mainComponent === null` case is documented in the Plugin API but was not reproduced live in Experiment 10; Experiment 11 (#309) unit-test-covers the helper's routing for that branch (override-error + no `sourceChildId` → annotate with `could not apply automatically:` markdown — see ADR-011 Verification), so the code path is regression-locked while live Figma reproduction remains a manual fixture-seeding follow-up. Under the default (`allowDefinitionWrite: false`), the definition write never fires and this throw cannot surface. **The pre-flight `probeDefinitionWritability` (#357) detects both branches up-front** so the Definition write picker can drop the opt-in option entirely when every candidate is unwritable, saving the user a wasted decision before the runtime fallback kicks in.
